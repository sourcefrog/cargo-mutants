# Incremental tests of modified code

If you're working on a large project or one with a long test suite, you may not want to test the entire codebase every time you make a change. You can use `cargo-mutants --in-diff` to test only mutants generated from recently changed code.

The `--in-diff DIFF_FILE` option tests only mutants that overlap with regions changed in the diff.

The diff is expected to either have a prefix of `b/` on the new filename, which is the format produced by `git diff`, or no prefix.

Some ways you could use `--in-diff`:

1. Before submitting code, check your uncommitted changes with `git diff`.
2. In CI, or locally, check the diff between the current branch and the base branch of the pull request.

Changes to non-Rust files, or files from which no mutants are produced, are ignored.

`--in-diff` is applied on the output of other filters including `--package` and `--regex`. For example, `cargo mutants --in-diff --package foo` will only test mutants in the `foo` package that overlap with the diff.

## Caution

`--in-diff` makes tests faster by covering the mutants that are most likely to be missed in the changed code. However, it's certainly possible that edits in one region cause code in a different region or a different file to no longer be well tested. Incremental tests are helpful for giving faster feedback, but they're not a substitute for a full test run.

## Example

In this diff, we've added a new function `two` to `src/lib.rs`, and the existing code is unaltered. With `--in-diff`, `cargo-mutants` will only test mutants that affect the function `two`.
