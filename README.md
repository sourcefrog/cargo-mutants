cargo-mutants is a mutation testing tool for Rust. It guides you to missing
test coverage by finding functions whose implementation could be replaced by
something trivial and the tests would all still pass.

Coverage measurements can be helpful, but they really tell you what code is
_reached_ by a test, and not whether the test really assert anything about the
behavior of the code. Mutation tests give different, perhaps richer
information, about whether the tests really check the code's behavior.

**CAUTION**: This tool builds and runs code with machine-generated
modifications. If the code under test, or the test suite, has side effects such
as writing or deleting files, running it with mutations may be dangerous.
Think first about what side effects the test suite could possibly have,
and/or run it in a restricted or disposable environment.

**NOTE:** cargo-mutants is still pretty new! It can find some interesting
results, but because it has a very basic idea of which functions to mutate and
how, it generates significant false positives and false negatives. The
proof-of-concept is successful, though, and I think the results can be
iteratively improved.

## Install

    cargo install cargo-mutants

## Using cargo-mutants

Just run `cargo mutants` in a Rust source directory, and it will point out
functions that may be inadequately tested:

    % cargo mutants --dir ~/src/unix_mode/
    baseline test with no mutations ... ok
    replace type_bits with Default::default() in src/lib.rs:42:32 ... caught
    replace is_file with Default::default() in src/lib.rs:52:35 ... caught
    replace is_dir with Default::default() in src/lib.rs:62:34 ... caught
    replace is_symlink with Default::default() in src/lib.rs:72:38 ... caught
    replace is_fifo with Default::default() in src/lib.rs:77:35 ... caught
    replace is_char_device with Default::default() in src/lib.rs:82:42 ... caught
    replace is_block_device with Default::default() in src/lib.rs:87:43 ... NOT CAUGHT!
    ...

In this version of the `unix_mode` crate, the `is_block_device` function was
indeed untested. The gap was fixed by adding a
[doctest](https://github.com/sourcefrog/unix_mode/blob/07e098c1f06d9971f26fe05afa65c3e36135e81f/src/lib.rs#L239-L242).

The Cargo output is logged into `mutants.out` within the original source
directory, so you can see why individual tests failed.

To see what mutants could be generated without running them, use `--list`.
`--list` also supports either a `--json` or `--diff` option.

### Skipping functions

To mark functions so they are not mutated:

1. Add a Cargo dependency on the [mutants](https://crates.io/crates/mutants) crate.

2. Mark functions with `#[mutants::skip]`.

The crate is tiny and the attribute has no effect on the compiled code. It only
flags the function for cargo-mutants.

### Exit codes

* **0**: Success. No mutants were found that weren't caught by tests.

* **1**: Usage error: bad command-line arguments etc.

* **2**: Found some mutants that were not covered by tests.

* **3**: Some tests timed out: possibly the mutatations caused an infinite loop,
  or the timeout is too low.

* **4**: The tests are already failing in a copy of the clean tree, so no mutations were tested.

### Tips

* Trees that `deny` style lints such as unused parameters are likely to fail to
  build when mutated, without really saying much about the value of the tests.
  I suggest you don't statically deny warnings in your source code, but rather
  set `RUSTFLAGS` when you do want to check this.

* Anything you can do to make the `cargo build` and `cargo test` suite faster
  will have a multiplicative effect on `cargo mutants` run time, and of course
  will also make normal development more pleasant. There's lots of good advice
  on the web.

### Hard-to-test cases

Some functions don't cause a test suite failure if emptied, but also cannot be
removed. For example, functions to do with managing caches or that have other
performance side effects.

Ideally, these should be tested, but doing so in a way that's not flaky can be
difficult. cargo-mutants can help in a few ways:

* It helps to at least highlight to the developer that the function is not
  covered by tests, and so should perhaps be treated with extra care, or tested
  manually.
* A `#[mutants::skip]` annotation can be added to suppress warnings and explain
  the decision.
* Sometimes these effects can be tested by making the side-effect observable
  with, for example, a counter of the number of memory allocations or cache
  misses/hits.

## Goals

**The overall goal for cargo-mutants is: when run on an arbitrary Rust source tree where
`cargo test` passes, it will tell you something *interesting* about areas where
bugs might be lurking or the tests might be insufficient.**

Being *easy* to use means:

* It requires no changes to the source tree or other setup: just install and
  run.

* There's no effect on the operation of the program other than when run under
  `cargo mutants`.

* It is reasonably fast even on large Rust trees. The overall run time is,
  roughly, the product of the number of viable mutations multiplied by the time
  to run the test suite for each mutation. Typically, one `cargo mutants` run
  will give you all the information it can find about missing test coverage in
  the tree, and you don't need to run it again as you iterate on tests, so it's
  relatively OK if it takes a while.

* cargo-mutants should avoid generating "unviable" mutants that "obviously"
  won't compile, because that wastes time. However, when it's uncertain whether
  the mutant will build, it's worth trying things that *might* find interesting
  results even if they might fail to build.  Over time, we expect to make it
  smarter about avoiding useless mutations and generating more interesting
  mutations.

* It runs correctly on any Rust source trees that are built and tested by Cargo,
  that will build and run their tests in a copy of the tree, and that have
  hermetic tests.

* cargo-mutants doesn't crash or hang, even if it generates mutants that cause
  the software under test to crash or hang.

* The results are reproducible, assuming the test suite is deterministic.

*Interesting results* mean:

* It tells you about places where the code could be wrong (or might already be
  wrong) and the test suite wouldn't catch it.

* *Most*, ideally all, findings should indicate something that really should be
  tested more, or that may already be buggy.

* It complements coverage tools by finding code that might be executed by a test
  (and show up as covered) but where the test result does not actually *depend
  on* the behavior of the code.

* It complements fuzzing or property testing by covering code that might be hard
  to hook up to a fuzzer interface, or where that work just has not been done
  yet.

* It's easy to understand what the output is telling you. It may take some
  thought about how to effectively test the under-tested code, but at least it's
  easy to see the potential bug that wouldn't be caught.

* Although run time matters, it's worth spending more time to generate more
  mutants that might find interesting results, even if some of them might not
  compile.

* Realistically, cargo-mutants may find some mutants that aren't caught by tests
  but also aren't interesting, or aren't feasible to test. In those cases it
  should be easy to permanently dismiss them (e.g. by adding a
  `#[mutants::skip]` attribute or a config file.)

* As much as possible it should avoid generating trivial mutants, where the
  mutated code is equivalent to the original code, and so it's not interesting
  that the test suite doesn't catch the change.

* On trees that are already very well-tested, cargo-mutants may find nothing
  interesting, and then it should just say so.

* And for trees that are thoroughly tested, you can use `cargo mutants` in CI
  to check that they remain so.

## Limitations, caveats, known bugs, and future enhancements

* cargo-mutants has a limited repertoire of mutations it can generate. As this
  improves, it will generate more interesting results, and I expect this can
  incrementally improve over time.

* It also currently has a limited understanding of function return types, and so
  sometimes generates "unviable" mutants that won't build, which wastes some
  time. These also seem easy to improve. In particular:

  * It should skip functions with `#[cfg(...)]` attributes that don't match the
    current platform, but it does not yet.

  * It should also probably skip `unsafe` functions, and maybe functions
    containing `unsafe {}` blocks.

  * I can't think of a good mutation that returns `&mut`, so functions returning
    mutable references should be skipped.

  * (There are several others.)

* It currently only mutates "item" (top-level) functions, not methods. This
  should be easy to add.

* cargo-mutants sees the AST of the tree but doesn't fully "understand" the
  types. Possibly it could learn to get type information from the compiler (or
  rust-analyzer?), which would help it generate more interesting viable mutants,
  and fewer unviable mutants.

* It might be helpful to distinguish whether the build failed, or the mutation
  was caught by tests. Ideally, cargo-mutants would never generate code that
  just won't build, firstly because it's a waste of time, and secondly because
  it may indicate a missed opportunity to generate more interesting mutants that
  would build.

* Some mutations will cause the program to hang or spin, for example if the
  mutation causes the condition of a `while` loop to always be true. For now,
  you'll need to notice and interrupt `cargo mutants` yourself, but I plan to
  add a timeout. (On Unix we need to run the build in a process group so that
  the actual test process is terminated.)

* Copying the tree to build it doesn't work well if the `Cargo.toml` points to
  dependencies by a relative `path` (other than in subdirectories). This could
  be handled by an option to mutate in-place (maybe into a copy made by the
  user) or possibly an option to copy a larger containing directory. You can
  work around this by editing `Cargo.toml` to make the paths absolute, before
  running `cargo mutants`.

* Copying a Rust tree and its `target/` directory seems to cause the first build
  to be slower than an incremental build in the source directory, even while
  mtimes are preserved. (Perhaps the path is part of the calculation whether
  files need to be rebuilt?) Later incremental builds are faster.
  [`sccache`](https://crates.io/crates/sccache) might help with this but I have
  not yet tested it. However, copying `target/` is still generally faster than
  not copying it.

* To make this faster on large trees, we could keep several scratch trees and
  test them in parallel, which is likely to exploit CPU resources more
  thoroughly than Cargo's own parallelism: in particular Cargo tends to fall
  down to a single task during linking, and often comes down to running a single
  straggler test at a time.

* It currently assumes all the source is in `src/` of the directory, but Cargo
  doesn't require that, and some crates have their source in a different
  directory. This could be fixed by reading `cargo metadata`.

* Mutated functions could discard all parameters to avoid strict warnings about
  them being unused. (I haven't seen any crates yet that enforce this.)

## How it works

The basic approach is:

* Build a list of mutations:
  * Walk all source files and parse each one looking for functions.
  * Skip functions that should not be mutated for any of several reasons:
    because they're tests, because they have a `#[mutants::skip]` attribute,
    etc.
  * For each function, depending on its return type, generate every mutation
    pattern that produces a result of that type.
* Make a copy of the whole tree into a scratch directory. The same directory is
  reused across all the mutations to benefit from incremental builds.
  * Before applying any mutations, check that `cargo test` succeeds in the
    scratch directory: perhaps a test is already broken, or perhaps the tree
    doesn't build when copied because it relies on relative paths to find
    dependencies, etc.
* For each mutation:
  * Apply the mutation to the scratch tree by patching the affected file.
  * Run `cargo test` in the tree, saving output to a log file.
  * If the build fails or the tests fail, that's good: the mutation was somehow caught.
  * If the build and tests succeed, that might mean test coverage was
    inadequate, or it might mean we accidentally generated a no-op mutation.
    (Doing so is a shortcoming in this tool.)
  * Revert the mutation to return the tree to its clean state.

The nice thing about `Default` is that it's defined on many commonly-used types
including `()`, so cargo-mutants does not need to really understand the function
return type at this early stage. Some functions will fail to build because they
return a type that does not implement `Default`, and that's OK.

The file is parsed using the [`syn`](https://docs.rs/syn) crate, but mutations
are applied textually, rather than to the token stream, so that unmutated code
retains its prior formatting, comments, line numbers, etc. This makes it
possible to show a text diff of the mutation and should make it easier to
understand any error messages from the build of the mutated code.

## Related work

cargo-mutants was  inspired by reading about the [Descartes mutation-testing
tool for Java](https://github.com/STAMP-project/pitest-descartes/) described in
[Increment magazine's testing
issue](https://increment.com/reliability/testing-beyond-coverage/).

It's an interesting insight that mutation at the level of a whole function is a
practical sweet-spot to discover missing tests, while (at least at moderate-size
trees) still making it feasible to exhaustively generate every mutant.

### Mutagen

There's an existing Rust mutation testing tool called
[Mutagen](https://github.com/llogiq/mutagen).

Some differences are:

* Mutagen seems more mature.

* Mutagen requires changes to the source tree, and for functions to be mutated
  to be marked with an attribute. cargo-mutants can work with any unmodified
  tree.

* Mutagen builds the tree only once; cargo-mutants does an incremental build for
  each mutation.

  This is slower, although for some trees the incremental build may be
  relatively cheap compared to running the test suite.

  On the up side building for each mutation gives cargo-mutants the freedom to
  try mutations it's not sure will compile.

* Mutagen has a neat system to use coverage information to run only the tests
  that could possibly be affected. This could potentially be ported.

* Mutagen needs a nightly compiler; cargo-mutants should work with any
  reasonably-recent compiler and is tested on stable.

* (Probably there are more. Please let me know.)

## Stability

cargo-mutants is in alpha and behavior, output formats, command-line syntax,
etc, may change from one release to the next.
